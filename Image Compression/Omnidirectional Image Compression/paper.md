- abstract: In this paper, we make one of the first attempts to learn deep neural networksfor omnidirectional image compression.
We thenpropose pseudocylindrical convolutions for 360째 image compression. 
To demonstrate the feasibility of our idea, we implement an end-to-end 360째 image compression system, consisting of the learned pseudocylindrical representation, an analysis transform, a non-uniform quantizer, a synthesis transform, and an entropy model.

- contribution:
(1) We propose a computationally tractable greedy algorithm to determine the (sub)-optimal parameter configuration in terms of the rate-distortion performance, estimated by a novel proxy objective.
Interestingly, we find that the optimized representation does not correspond to pseudocylindrical projections with the equal-area property(e.g., sinusoidal projection). 
(2) We propose pseudocylindrical convolutions that work seamlessly with the parametric pseudocylindrical representation for 360째 image compression.
(3) We build an end-to-end 360째 image compression system, which is composed of the optimized pseudocylindrical representation, an analysis transform, a non-uniform quantizer, a synthesis transform, and a context-based entropy model.
