## Your Attention is Unique: Detecting 360-Degree Video Saliency in Head-Mounted Display for Head Movement Prediction

- year: MM 2018

- dataset：  **(synthetic data )**  

- abstract: In this paper, we take an important step in exploring head move- ment prediction for 360-degree videos by leveraging the unique panoramic saliency. Motivated by the issues of central bias and multi-object confusion in traditional saliency models, we present PanoSalNet to detect panoramic saliency using the new self-built dataset. Then the proposed head movement prediction framework is trained based on the combination of panoramic saliency and head orientation history. 


- Contributions:
(1) A public dataset of panoramic saliency for 360-degree video studies.
(2) An accurate panoramic saliency detection model to identify the visual attention in 360-degree videos.
(3) A promising head movement prediction model to allow vari- ous system designs in 360-degree videos.

- structure: Sciliency detection model.
