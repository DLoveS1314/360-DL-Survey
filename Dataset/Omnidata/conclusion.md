##  Omnidata: A Scalable Pipeline for Making Multi-Task Mid-Level Vision Datasets from 3D Scans
- conference: ICCV, 2021

- dataset: synthetic dataset.

- abstract: This paper introduces a pipeline, Omnidata , to bridge the gap between real-world 3D scans and static vision datasets. The pipeline makes it possible to generate large and diverse datasets for many tasks with greater control over the data generation parameters, and to pursue fundamental lines of research such as how the data sampling strategy and collected cues impact model reliability.
