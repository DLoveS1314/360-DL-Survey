- year: 2018

- dataset：  **(AVTrack360)**  

- abstract:  In this paper, we present a viewing test with 48 subjects watching 20 different entertaining omnidirectional videos on an HTC Vive Head Mounted Display (HMD) in a task-free scenario. While the subjects were watching the contents, we recorded their head movements. The paper presents the general angular ranges of the subjects’ exploration behavior as well as an analysis of the areas where most of the time was spent.
