## Matterport3D: Learning from RGB-D Data in Indoor Environments

- year: 2017 
- dataset: Real-world dataset

- Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Matterport3D, a large-scale RGB-D dataset containing 10,800 panoramic views from 194,400 RGB-D images of 90 building-scale scenes. Annotations are provided with surface reconstructions, camera poses, and 2D and 3D se- mantic segmentations. The precise global alignment and comprehensive, diverse panoramic set of views over entire buildings enable a variety of supervised and self-supervised computer vision tasks, including keypoint matching, view overlap prediction, normal prediction from color, semantic segmentation, and region classification.

- Analysis: This dataset utilizes 18 2D images to synthesize a 360 image. Similar process can be applied to depth images. Totally, Matterport3D dataset contains about 10000 360 RGB-D images.
