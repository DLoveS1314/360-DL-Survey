## A Large-scale Compressed 360-Degree Spherical Image database: from Subjective Quality Evaluation to Objective Model Comparison

- year: 2018

- dataset：  **( largest compressed 360-degree image database: CVIQD2018)**  

- abstract:  In this paper, we present a study on subjective assessment of compressed 360-degree images and investigate whether existing objective image quality assessment **(IQA)** (IQA) methods can effectively evaluate the quality of compressed 360-degree images.

- dataset: We first construct the largest compressed 360-degree image database (CVIQD2018) including 16 source images and 528 compressed ones with three prevailing coding technologies. Then, we implement 16 full reference (FR) IQA metrics, which include 10 traditional IQA metrics for 2D images  and 3 PSNR-based metrics for 360-degree images, as well as 5 no reference (NR) IQA metrics and calculate the correlation between each above metric and subjective assessment in terms of three commonly used performance indices.

- analysis: We built the largest compressed VR image quality database (CVIQD2018), including 16 sources images and 528 compressed ones under three coding technologies, i.e. JPEG, H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC. Moreover, we compare 13 FR IQA models including 3 PSNRbased models for 360-degree images as well as 5 NR IQA models.
