## Whatâ€™s in my Room? Object Recognition on Indoor Panoramic Images

- year: 2020

- dataset: SUN extended dataset (self-collected)

- Abstract: This paper provides an object recognition system that performs object detection and semantic segmentation tasks by using a deep learning model adapted to match the nature of equirectangular images. From these results, instance segmentation masks are recovered, refined and transformed into 3D bounding boxes that are placed into the 3D model of the room.

- Contributions:
(1) An object recognition system that performs object detection and semantic segmentation tasks
(2) Instance segmentation masks are generated from the above two tasks.
(3) 3D bounding boxes are recovered from refined instance segmentation masks.

- Structure: Panoramic BlitzNet

-Analysis: Two tasks, i.e., object detection and semantic segmentation to achieve instance segmentation, and then achieve 3D bounding boxes.
