## Omnisupervised Omnidirectional Semantic Segmentation

- year: 2022

- dataset: PASS, Mapillary Vistas and IDD20K

- abstract:In this paper, we propose an omnisupervised learning framework for efficient CNNs, which bridges multiple heterogeneous data sources that are already available in the community, bypassing the labor-intensive process to have manually annotated panoramas, while improving the irreliability in unseen omnidirectional domains.
