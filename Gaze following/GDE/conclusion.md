## Transfer beyond the Field of View: Dense Panoramic Semantic Segmentation via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

- conference: ICCV, 2021

- dataset: the proposed dataset: GazeFollow360

- abstract: Firstly, this work builds a novel dataset DensePASS for semantic segmentation in 360 degree domain. Secondly, this paper introduces P2PDA - a generic framework for PINHOLEâ†’PANORAMIC semantic segmentation which addresses the challenge of domain divergence with different variants of attention-augmented domain adaptation modules, enabling the transfer in output-, feature-, and feature confidence spaces. P2PDA intertwines uncertainty-aware adaptation using confi- dence values regulated on-the-fly through attention heads with discrepant predictions. The proposed method performs greater on the novel dataset DensePASS than other baseline methods.
