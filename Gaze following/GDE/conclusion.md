## Transfer beyond the Field of View: Dense Panoramic Semantic Segmentation via Unsupervised Domain Adaptation

- conference: ICCV, 2021

- dataset: the proposed dataset: GazeFollow360

- abstract: First, we collect the first dataset, “GazeFollow360”, for this task, contain- ing around 10,000 360-degree images with complex gaze behaviors under various scenes. Second, we propose a 3D sight line guided dual-pathway framework, to detect the gaze target within a local region (here) and from a distant region (there), parallelly.

- contributions: 
(1)This is the first work that studies gaze following in 360-degree images. 
(2) We establish “GazeFol- low360”, the first large-scale dataset for gaze following in 360-degree images which contains 10,058 4K high resolution images with annotations of heads and gaze targets. 
(3) We propose a sight line guided dual-pathway framework to address the mismatch between the sight line of a human subject and the gaze target in 360-degree images
