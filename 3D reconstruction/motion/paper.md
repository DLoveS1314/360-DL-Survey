## Robust 3D reconstruction with omni-directional camera based on structure from motion

- conference:  2018 International Workshop on Advanced Image Technology (IWAIT)

- abstract: 3D scenes reconstruction with omni-directional camera is of utmost significance as the camera can capture the 360 degrees scene. It dramatically improves the performance of Structure from Motion (SfM) since the tracked interest points will not miss with a long base-line and sharp rotation. This paper proposes a system with preprocessing and modification based on conventional SfM pipeline for equirectangular images produced by omni-directional camera. The results show that proposed system can well estimate the accurate ego-motion and sparse 3D structure of a synthetic scene as well as a real-world scene by solving the problem of distortion and lower quality at certain area of the equirectangular images.
