## Learning Spherical Convolution for Fast Features from 360°Imagery

- year: 2016

- dataset：  **(88 indoor panoramas for evaluations withmanual annotation of vps, room layout faces, face orienta-tions and occluding lines)** 

- abstract:We propose a method to recover the shape of a 3D roomfrom a full-view indoor panorama. Our algorithm can au-tomatically infer a 3D shape from a collection of partiallyoriented superpixel facets and line segments. The core partof the algorithm is a constraint graph, which includes linesand superpixels as vertices, and encodes their geometricrelations as edges. A novel approach is proposed to per-form 3D reconstruction based on the constraint graph bysolving all the geometric constraints as constrained linearleast-squares. The selected constraints used for reconstruc-tion are identified using an occlusion detection method with a Markov random field.
