## 3D Scene Geometry Estimation from 360◦ Imagery: A Survey

- year: 2022

- **Survey** 

- abstract: We irst revisit the basic concepts of the spherical camera model and review 
the most common acquisition technologies and representation formats suitable for omnidirectional 
(also called 360◦, spherical or panoramic) images and videos. We then survey monocular 
layout and depth inference approaches, highlighting the recent advances in learning-based solutions suited for spherical data.
