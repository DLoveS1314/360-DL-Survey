## A Survey on Adaptive 360◦ Video Streaming: Solutions, Challenges and Opportunities

- year: 2020

- Abstract: This paper presents the state-of-the-art on adaptive 360-degree video delivery solutions considering end-to-end video streaming in general and then specifically of 360-degree video delivery. Current and emerging solutions for adaptive 360◦ video streaming, including viewport-independent, viewport-dependent, and tile-based schemes are presented. Next, solutions for network-assisted unicast and multicast streaming of 360-degree video content are discussed. Different research challenges for both on-demand and live 360-degree video streaming are also analyzed. Several proposed standards and technologies and top international research projects are then presented.
