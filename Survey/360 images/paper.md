## State-of-the-Art in 360° Video/Image Processing: Perception, Assessment and Compression

- year: 2020

- abstract:  we review the state-of-the-art works on 360° video/image processing from the aspects of perception, 
  assessment and compression. First, this article reviews both datasets and visual attention modelling approaches 
  for 360° video/image. Second, we survey the related works on both subjective and objective visual quality assessment 
  (VQA) of 360° video/image. Third, we overview the compression approaches for 360° video/image, which either 
  utilize the spherical characteristics or visual attention models. 
  Finally, we summarize this overview article and outlook the future research trends on 360° video/image processing.

- Analysis:
  This survey about 360° video/image.
