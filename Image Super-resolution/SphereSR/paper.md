## SphereSR: 360-degree Image Super-Resolution with Arbitrary Projection via Continuous Spherical Image Representation

- year: 2022

- dataset: ODI-SR dataset, and SUN360 panorama dataset

- Abstract: In this paper, we propose SphereSR, a novel framework to generate a continuous spherical image representation from an LR 360-degree image, aiming at predicting the RGB values at given spherical coordinates for super-resolution with an arbitrary 360-degree image projection.
- Contributions:
 (1) We propose a novel framework, called SphereSR, aiming at super-resolving an LR 360-degree image to an HR image with an arbitrary projection type;
 (2) We propose a feature extraction module that represents the spherical data based on icosahedron and extracts features on spherical surface;
 (3) We propose SLIIF that predicts RGB values from the spherical coordinates;
 (4) Our method achieves the significantly better performance in the extensive experiments.
