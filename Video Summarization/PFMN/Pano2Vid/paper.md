## Pano2Vid: Automatic Cinematography for Watching 360-degree Videos


- year: 2016

- dataset: Pano2Vid dataset (self-collected)

- Abstract: We introduce the novel task of Pano2Vid — automatic cinematography in panoramic 360-degree videos. We first compile a dataset of 360-degree videos downloaded from the web. Next, we propose AutoCam, a data-driven approach to solve the Pano2Vid task.
- Contributions:
  (1) we formulate the computer vision problem of automatic cinematography in 360-degree video (Pano2Vid), (2) we propose a novel Pano2Vid algorithm (AutoCam), (3) we compile a dataset of 360-degree web video, annotated with ground truth human-directed NFOV camera trajectories and (4) we propose a comprehensive suite of objective and subjective evaluation protocols to benchmark Pano2Vid task performance. We benchmark AutoCam against several baselines and show that it is the most successful at virtually capturing natural-looking NFOV video.

-Analysis: This work proposes a new 360 video problem. To address this problem, they provide a new dataset and a method named "AutoCam".
