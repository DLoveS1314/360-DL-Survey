## Minimal Solutions for Panoramic Stitching Given Gravity Prior

- year: 2021

- dataset: SUN360 panorama dataset, and Smartphone dataset (self-collected)

- Abstract: We propose new minimal solutions to panoramic stitching of images taken by cameras with coinciding optical centers. We consider six practical cam- era configurations, from fully calibrated ones up to a camera with unknown fixed or varying focal length and with or without radial distortion. The solvers are tested both on synthetic scenes, on more than 500k real image pairs from the Sun360 dataset, and from scenes captured by us using two smartphones equipped with IMUs.
