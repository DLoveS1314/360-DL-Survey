## Cross-Reference Stitching Quality Assessmentfor 360◦Omnidirectional Images

- dataset: Omnidirectional Dataset(We use a set of Samsung gear 360 fisheye camera to capture data invarious conditions to enhance the robustness.)

- abstract:
we first establish a novel omnidirectional image dataset containing stitched images as well as dual-fisheye images captured from standard quarters of 0◦, 90◦,180◦, and 270◦. 
Based on this dataset, we propose a set of Omnidirectional Stitching Image Quality Assessment (OS-IQA) metrics.
