## SpherePHD: Applying CNNs on a Spherical PolyHeDron Representation of 360-degree Images
- year: 2019

- dataset: MNIST dataset, SYNTHIA sequence dataset, and Stanford2D3D dataset

- Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to resolve such problems of applying CNNs to omni-directional images. The proposed method utilizes a spherical polyhedron to represent omni-directional views. This method minimizes the variance of the spatial resolving power on the sphere surface, and includes new convolution and pooling methods for the proposed representation. The proposed method can also be adopted by any existing CNN-based methods.
- Contributions:
(1) A spherical polyhedron-based representation of images (SpherePHD); (2) Design a convolution kernel; (3) Apply convolution and pooling kernels on the proposed spherical polyhedron representation of images.

- Structure: SpherePHD

-Analysis: This work novely introduces a spherical polyhedron to represent omni-directional views. It also demonstrates its flexibility on various tasks. However, the computation complexity is still large. The later work, e.g., SphereSR, optimizes this drawback effectively.
