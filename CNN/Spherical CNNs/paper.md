## SPHERICAL CNNS

- year: 2018

- dataset: spherical MNIST, shapeNet (Synthetic)

- abstract: In this paper we introduce the building blocks for constructing spherical CNNs.
We propose a definition for the spherical cross-correlation that is both expressive and rotation-equivariant. 

- contribution:
(1) The theory of spherical CNNs.
(2) The first automatically differentiable implementation of the generalized Fourier transformforS2andSO(3).
Our PyTorch code is easy to use, fast, and memory efficient.
(3) The first empirical support for the utility of spherical CNNs for rotation-invariant learning problems.

- analysis:
Perhaps the most exciting future application of the Spherical CNN is in omnidirectional vision.
Although very little omnidirectional image data is currently available in public repositories, the increasing prevalence of omnidirectional sensors in drones, robots, and autonomous cars makes this a very compelling application of our work.
