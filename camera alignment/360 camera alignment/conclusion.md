## 360o Camera Alignment via Segmentation

- conference: ECCV, 2020

- dataset: Deep360Up, Coarse2Fine, and Sun360.

- abstract: We train a deep neural net-work to leverage these cues to segment the image-space endpoints of an imagined “vertical axis”, which is orthogonal to the ground plane of a scene, thus levelling the camera. We show that our segmentation-based strategy significantly increases performance, reducing errors by half, com-pared to the current state-of-the-art on two datasets of 360o imagery.

- contributions: 
(1) We proposed a novel method for aligning cerame images.
(2) The proposed method performs well on three dataset.
